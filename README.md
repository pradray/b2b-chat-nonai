# B2B Chat (Non-AI Demo)

This repository contains a small demo project with a React + Vite frontend and a Python (Flask) backend that together demonstrate a simple chat workflow.

Please see the service-level README files for setup and run instructions:

- Frontend (Vite + React): `frontend/README.md`
- Backend (Flask): `backend/README.md`

If you prefer a combined quick-start, open `frontend/README.md` and `backend/README.md` in separate terminals — each document contains commands and troubleshooting steps tailored to that service.
